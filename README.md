This is my third portfolio website and my third year using React so I really want this project to stand out from my past projects in terms of design and development.

Here's What I'm Doing Different:

- 100% Typescript. Maybe its overkill for what could be such a simple project but types are too hard to pass up.
- Bulletproof React as a guide. React is very opinionated so writing code that employers will like is very daunting, that's where the [Bulletproof React Repo](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) comes into play.
- Tailwind CSS instead of Styled Components. The days of writing hours and hours of CSS everyday are over in this project. Better time management is another key principal i'm trying to learn with this project. :smile:
- Github Workflow. I've always used Github but with this project i'm diving deep into Github Issues and utilizing branches.
